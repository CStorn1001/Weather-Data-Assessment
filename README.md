Cuusoo Technical Assessment

Tools used:
* Python
* Studio3T
* MapReduce through MRJob
* Python libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, PyMongo

How to run: \n
*Should be able to open up the following files via Visual Studio Code 
*Everything should be there to look at, might be difficult to run as I used a MongoDB connection


NOTES: \n
*Text files are to write the wanted data for the parts
*Jupiter Notebook is the main place to start
*Part A will include a python script this is the MapReduce program
*I decided to make two CSV files for Part A and one for Part B
*MapReduce is run via commandline -> python part_a_script.py part_a_metric.txt > output.part_a_metric.csv
